-----Friday Night Jammin'-----

Hello user and thank you for downloading this ghost/ukagaka of Boyfriend and Girlfriend from Friday Night funkin'. This ghost was created during the 2021 ghost jam, which lasted a week.

This ghost was made using the GT Ghost Template here: http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/. I (Quonit) drew the art and coded it, while Sosig wrote much of the dialogue and bugtested.
